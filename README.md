# Stock-Backtesting-Engine
# Overview
The Stock Backtesting Engine is a Streamlit application designed to help users backtest stock trading strategies using historical data. Users can select one or more stocks, configure their portfolio, and run a backtest on different trading strategies. The app provides detailed performance metrics, including returns, win/loss ratios, Sharpe ratio, maximum drawdown, and more. It also visualizes portfolio performance compared to a buy-and-hold strategy (HODL) and displays buy/sell signals based on selected strategies.

# Features
**Stock Selection:** Choose from a variety of global indices (e.g., Dow Jones, S&P 500, Nifty50).


**Backtest Configuration:**

Set portfolio allocation for each selected stock.

Choose initial capital, investment style (Aggressive, Moderate, Passive), and transaction costs.

Define stop-loss and take-profit percentages.


# **Strategy Options:**


**Moving Average Crossover:** Backtest a strategy based on short-term vs long-term moving averages.

**Bollinger Bands:** Buy when the stock price goes below the lower Bollinger Band and sell when it goes above the upper band.

**Combined Strategy:** A mix of both Moving Average Crossover and Bollinger Bands.

**Performance Metrics:** Evaluate the strategy's performance with metrics like total return, annualized return, Sharpe ratio, and more.

# Notes

The app currently supports stock data from Yahoo Finance (via yfinance), so historical data may not be available for all tickers or may be limited based on the stock.

Make sure the total allocation for your portfolio sums to 100%. The app will notify you if the allocation is incorrect.

The backtest duration should be at least a few months to generate meaningful results, especially for strategies like moving averages or Bollinger Bands.
